Building jwordpress from source:
------------------------------

First read the attached COPYING file before using this software anywhere. It's
free, but not as in free willy.

In order to install, you need java and ant. Ant is available from
http://ant.apache.org/ . I compiled it via Java 6, it may work with Java 5 but
some classes in commons library are incompatible, so you'll have to figure it
out.

ant make-clidist :
    This will create a zip file that contains the jar file and the wrapper
    script for running the command line interface. Try './jwordpress -?'
    for a list of command line options.

ant compilelib :
    This will create a jar file that contains the API, not the CLI, which can
    be used for linking other Java code.

ant javadoc :
    This will generate javadocs under doc/ directory.

ant install :
    This will install files to /usr/bin by default, you can change the
    installation prefix by 'ant -Dinstallprefix=(somewhereelse) install'.

There are other ant targets, but I suspect anyone ever needs to use them. Feel
free to browse build.xml and let me know anything bizarre that requires
explanation here.
